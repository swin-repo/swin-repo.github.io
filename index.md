# SouthWest Internet of Things Network Project

## Revolutionising the Use of Smart Tech in the Southwest

SWIN will enable Low Power devices to use long-range gateways to connect to a decentralised network to exchange data with applications. These Low Powered devices can run on a simple small battery for years and operate on a free part of the network.

We are looking to work with interested partners to roll out this network. It will be owned, operated by and work for the Southwest.

We are Already Working with these partners to create an IoT network in the Southwest
